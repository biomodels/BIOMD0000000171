Download this repository, and install with distutils

`python setup.py install`

Or, install using pip

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000171.git`

To install a specific version (in this example, from the 2014-09-16 BioModels release)

`pip install git+https://github.com/biomodels/BIOMD0000000171.git@20140916`

## Usage

Importing the model package.

`import BIOMD0000000171 as model`

Get the SBML string from the model

`print model.sbmlString`

# Model Notes


# Leloup and Goldbeter, 1998

This model was created after the article by Leloup and Goldbeter, _J Biol
Rhythms_ 1998, Vol:13(1),pp70-87, pubmedID: 9486845  
A Model for Circadian Rhythms in _Drosophila_ Incorporating the Formation of a
Complex between the PER and TIM Proteins  
The parameters and initial concentrations are taken to reproduce figs. 4 D,E,F
in the publication.  
For a simulation without light dependent degradation of TIM_pp, change the the
parameter _v_dT_fac_ to 1.  
The light/dark phases length can be set using the parameter _l_d_ .
