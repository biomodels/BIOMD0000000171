This model was created after the article by Leloup and Goldbeter, _J Biol
Rhythms_ 1998, Vol:13(1),pp70-87, pubmedID: 9486845  
A Model for Circadian Rhythms in _Drosophila_ Incorporating the Formation of a
Complex between the PER and TIM Proteins  
The parameters and initial concentrations are taken to reproduce figs. 4 D,E,F
in the publication.  
For a simulation without light dependent degradation of TIM_pp, change the the
parameter _v_dT_fac_ to 1.  
The light/dark phases length can be set using the parameter _l_d_ .
